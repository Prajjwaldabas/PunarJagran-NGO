                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Punarjagran Samiti is a growing NGO which formed in Oct, 2014 by 9 members group among are social
                    workers and is comprised of energetic group. The idea of establishment of the NGO took root from
                    when one of the associated members saw the underprivileged people struggling to earn a living and
                    they couldn’t feed their family two square meals a day. They also saw the privileged old-aged people
                    living by the side of the roads because they lacked a roof over their head which were the privileges
                    denied by their own children.

                <p>
                    In the starting, I was wondering how the pandemic and the lockdown has affected the people of that
                    strata. I was taken aback by how it has affected them leading to homeless life, living without
                    adequate food and then without education too. As I was a part of the Whatsapp group of the NGO, I
                    saw a few activities that were taken up at the Punar Jagran Samiti during the time of pandemic and
                    lockdown, that works for upliftment of under-privileged children, they taught them basic education,
                    provided free food to the under-privileged senior citizens and empowering women to help them be
                    independent and earn living.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They were eager to learn any and everything by learning every other small thing that might help them
                    secure a better future. The Children who were there, were very enthusiastic to learn about numbers,
                    basic sciences and computers. I had been ignorant about many things and taken them for granted in my
                    life, but now I can appreciate my life more and strive to help those in need.
